# This boot-tsk script ensures that the proper version of the main TSK file is present (`v` or `tsk_version` variable)
# and depending on its success outputs either:
# 1) the tsk file name
# 2) a path to a (dynamically generated) one-off error-reporting script,
# the only purpose of which is to describe what went wrong and exit with error code (1).
#
# In both cases it should be safe to call the script from an external program the following way:
# source $( curl boot-tsk-url | sh )
#
# so in the successful case the TSK will be sourced (and its definitions will come into the current scope)
# and in the case of error the failure will be reported nicely and program will exit
# (note that if you want to call it from an interactive shell you need to use a subshell (wrap it with parens):
# ( source $( curl boot-tsk-url | sh ) ), because on error it would end your shell session ).
#
# The TSK versions present on disk are left alone unless the version is trunk (meaning "latest"),
# in which case this script tries to download the most recent version of itself and of TSK.
